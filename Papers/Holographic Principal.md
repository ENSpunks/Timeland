# Causal Relativity: Holographic Principle Without Time

### Definitions

- **Holomass:** In the context of Causal Relativity, holomass is quantized mass that, according to the Holographic Principle, is encoded on the boundary of the spatial curvature rather than being distributed throughout a 3D volume. This boundary is where the information content of the mass is stored, reflecting the idea that all physical information within a region of space can be described by its surface.

### Holographic Principle in the Context of Causal Relativity

| **Causal Geometry** | **Phenomenon** | **Original Equation** | **Causal Relativity Equation** |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Mass+Light+Gravity** | **Holographic Principle** | \( S = \frac{A}{4l_p^2} \) | \( A = 4\pi r^2 \) |

## Summary of Interpretation

The Holographic Principle within Causal Relativity posits that the information within a 3D spatial volume is encoded on a 2D surface, specifically the gravity causal shell. Here, time is not a fundamental dimension; instead, interactions between mass and light are delineated through spatial curvature. Gravity is reimagined as a boundary condition where holomass and light interact, with the gravity shell mediating these interactions. 

**Holomass and Photon Emission:** Holomass, as encoded on the boundary of space curvature, is the source from which photons are emitted. Although the boundary and the emission of photons conceptually overlap, it's the quantized mass (holomass) itself that emits these photons, not the boundary. This maintains the geometric unity between quantized mass and light quanta within the 3D spatial framework.

## Developing the Mathematics

### Original Holographic Principle

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes relates entropy \( S \) to the area \( A \) of the event horizon:

\[ S = \frac{A}{4l_p^2} \]

where \( l_p \) is the Planck length, indicating that the entropy or amount of information in a region of space is proportional to the area of its boundary rather than its volume.

### Transition to Causal Geometry

In Causal Relativity, we eliminate the time dimension, focusing solely on spatial dimensions. Here, we propose:

- **Area as Information Encoding**: The information content of a 3D spatial region is encoded on its 2D boundary, which is the surface of the gravity sphere, where holomass resides.

- **Equation Simplification**: We drop the dependency on Planck length, focusing solely on geometry:

\[ A = 4\pi r^2 \]

This equation signifies the area where holomass information is encoded, without reference to time or direct quantum effects.

### Rigorous Mathematical Development

1. **Area as a Boundary Condition**: 
   - The area \( A \) represents the complete information content of the enclosed 3D space, where holomass is encoded.

2. **Quantized Mass and Light Interaction**:
   - Holomass on the boundary interacts with light. The spatial curvature influenced by holomass affects how light propagates, described by spatial intervals.

3. **Curvature and Encoding**:
   - The curvature of space around mass encodes holomass on the boundary, from which photons are emitted into 3D space, maintaining their geometric unity with the mass.

### Calculating a Known Problem

Consider the entropy of a black hole:

- **Traditional Calculation**: For a Schwarzschild black hole of mass \( M \), the horizon area is \( A = 16\pi G^2 M^2/c^4 \). Using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, we get:

\[ S_{traditional} = \frac{4\pi G M^2}{l_p^2 c^2} \]

- **Causal Geometry Calculation**: Here, we're not dealing with entropy directly but with information encoded spatially:

\[ A_{causal} = 4\pi r^2 \]

Where \( r \) is a spatial radius. Without time, we consider how this area contains the information of holomass, from which light is emitted.

### Unification

In traditional relativity, spacetime curvature dictates gravity and light paths. In Causal Relativity:

- **Gravity**: Is a spatial boundary condition where holomass and light interact, with photons emanating from the holomass.
- **Light**: Propagates due to spatial curvature from the holomass, not spacetime.

This suggests all interactions can be spatial, with photons and mass geometrically unified.

### Predictions

- **Observation of Spatial Effects**: Effects like gravitational lensing might be observed through spatial distortions alone.
- **New Gravitational Signatures**: If gravity is a boundary condition, new types of gravitational phenomena might be predicted, linked to how holomass emits photons.

## Conclusion

Causal Relativity reinterprets the Holographic Principle by removing time, proposing that physical phenomena are described through spatial geometry. This challenges our understanding of information, entropy, and causality, offering new gravitational insights. Experimental validation is crucial to confirm these propositions.
