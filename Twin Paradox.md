### Twin Paradox in Causal Relativity

#### **Abstract**

This paper re-examines the Twin Paradox through the lens of Causal Relativity, where traditional time dilation effects are reinterpreted as spatial phenomena. We explore how the spatial structure and causal interactions between light and mass account for the observed age difference between twins without invoking time as an independent dimension. Importantly, we demonstrate that the numerical outcome for the age difference remains identical to that predicted by Special Relativity (SR).

#### **Introduction**

The Twin Paradox, a classic thought experiment in Special Relativity (SR), illustrates the effects of time dilation due to relative motion. In this scenario, one twin (the traveler) embarks on a near-light-speed journey while the other (the stayer) remains on Earth. Upon reunion, the traveler is younger than the stayer, traditionally explained by time dilation. In Causal Relativity, we eliminate time's role as a fundamental dimension and focus on spatial interactions, yet the numerical outcome for the age difference remains the same.

#### **Causal Relativity Framework**

- **Spatial Contraction**: Instead of time dilation, we consider the spatial contraction experienced by the moving twin. The length of the journey appears shorter to the traveler due to their velocity relative to space.

- **Causal Paths**: The paths taken by light signals (which carry information about aging) between the twins are affected by their relative motion through space. These paths are not straight lines in a flat space but are influenced by the spatial geometry altered by velocity.

- **Energy and Mass Interaction**: The energy required to accelerate the traveling twin and the interaction with gravity fields (like Earth's) can be seen as altering the spatial relationship between the twins, influencing how their mutual light signals propagate.

#### **Reinterpreting the Paradox**

**Traditional SR Explanation**:
- One twin travels at \( v \) close to \( c \), leading to time dilation:
  \[ 
  \Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t, \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \]
  Here, \( \Delta t' \) is the time experienced by the traveler, and \( \Delta t \) is the time on Earth.

**Causal Relativity Approach**:

- **Spatial Path**: The traveling twin's journey through space is shortened due to their velocity. We denote the spatial distance as \( L \), contracted to \( L' \) in the moving frame:
  \[ 
  L' = L \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
  \]

- **Light Path and Causality**: Light signals between the twins are affected by this spatial contraction. If the traveler sends light signals back to Earth regularly, from the stayer's perspective, these signals arrive less frequently due to the Doppler shift and the contracted path.

- **Causal Geometry**: The traveler's path in space can be seen as taking a shorter "causal line" due to the spatial geometry. The differing lengths of these causal lines lead to different "effective" journeys, which we can interpret as aging differences.

#### **Calculation Example**

Let's consider a scenario where:

- The traveling twin goes on a round trip at \( v = 0.8c \) to a star 8 light-years away from Earth and back.
- The journey time in the Earth's frame is:
  \[ 
  t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{2 \times 8 \text{ light-years}}{0.8c} = 20 \text{ years}
  \]

**In SR**:

- The time dilation factor \( \gamma \) for \( v = 0.8c \) is:
  \[ 
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2}} \approx 1.667
  \]
- Time experienced by the traveler:
  \[ 
  t_{\text{traveler}} = \frac{t_{\text{Earth}}}{\gamma} \approx \frac{20}{1.667} \approx 12 \text{ years}
  \]

**In Causal Relativity**:

- The spatial contraction of the journey (one way):
  \[ 
  L' = 8 \text{ light-years} \times \sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2} \approx 4.8 \text{ light-years}
  \]
- Total spatial distance traveled by the traveler (round trip):
  \[ 
  L_{\text{total}}' = 2 \times 4.8 \text{ light-years} = 9.6 \text{ light-years}
  \]

- **Causal Interaction**: Instead of time dilation, consider that the causal paths of light signals between the twins are altered. The light signals from the traveler to the stayer, when the traveler is moving away, are redshifted and take longer to reach Earth, while those when returning are blueshifted, arriving more frequently. 

- **Effective Aging**: The spatial contraction implies that the traveler experiences fewer causal interactions (light signals, energy exchanges) over the same distance in their frame. Here, the number of these spatial events or causal interactions corresponds directly to the 12 years calculated by SR's time dilation, ensuring the **numerical outcome for the age difference is identical**.

- **Interpretation**: The 12 "effective" years experienced by the traveler in Causal Relativity are not temporal but spatial, representing the reduced number of causal events or spatial interactions during the journey.

---

#### **Conclusion**

In Causal Relativity, the Twin Paradox is explained through the geometry of space and the causal interactions within it. Despite reinterpreting time dilation effects as spatial phenomena, the numerical outcome regarding the age difference between the twins remains identical to that of Special Relativity. This reinterpretation maintains the observational outcomes of SR but frames them in spatial terms, removing the need for time as an independent dimension.
