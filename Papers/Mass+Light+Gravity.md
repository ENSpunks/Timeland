#### **Mass+Light+Gravity** 

Holographic Principle in the context of Causal Relativity:

| **Causal Geometry** | **Phenomenon** | **Original Equation** | **Causal Relativity Equation** |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Mass+Light+Gravity** | **Holographic Principle** | \( S = \frac{A}{4l_p^2} \) | \( A = 4\pi r^2 \) |

### Notes on the Interpretation:
- **Surface Area**: The equation \( A = 4\pi r^2 \) represents the area where information of the 3D space is encoded in a 2D manner, akin to how the holographic principle suggests that the information of a volume of space can be described by data on its boundary.
- **Causal Geometry Modification**: Here, we're considering this in a purely 3D spatial context without time. The gravity shell, therefore, becomes the mediator or interface where mass and light interact, rather than a temporal or spacetime construct.
- **Encoding**: The quantized mass and light are not moving through time but are instead encoded statically on the boundary; their interaction is described by the spatial curvature and not temporal progression. 

This interpretation frames gravity not just as a force or curvature of spacetime but as a fundamental boundary condition where the physics of mass and light are expressed in a spatial-only framework.
