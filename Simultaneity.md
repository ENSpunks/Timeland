# Simultaneity without Spacetime

## Abstract

This paper explores the concept of simultaneity within the Causal Relativity geometry, where traditional spacetime concepts are replaced by causal interactions within a three-dimensional spatial geometry. We argue that simultaneity can be understood as the intersection of causal shells from different masses, without invoking a time coordinate. Using mathematical formulation, we prove that events, which would be considered simultaneous within this framework, emerge through the interaction of causal shells expanding at the speed of light. This approach bypasses the need for a temporal dimension and resolves relativity's most perplexing aspects surrounding simultaneity. Additionally, we explore how this model can simplify and clarify complex relativistic scenarios, particularly in the context of gravitational effects on light and astronomical observations.

## 1. Introduction

In Einstein's theory of relativity, simultaneity is relative to the observer's frame of reference. This relativity arises from the constancy of the speed of light, leading to scenarios where two events that are simultaneous in one observer's frame are not simultaneous in another's. However, in the Causal Relativity framework, simultaneity is understood not as a temporal synchronization across frames, but rather as the intersection of expanding causal shells.

These causal shells represent the propagation of energy (light) and gravitational influence emanating from mass, moving outward at the speed of light. In this model, events become simultaneous when their causal shells intersect at the same spatial point, which is consistent with observations but does not require a time coordinate. This approach removes the traditional time coordinate from relativity and gives rise to a purely spatial interpretation of simultaneity. Furthermore, we explore how this framework offers a new perspective on simultaneity, avoiding the complexities of traditional spacetime while maintaining consistency with relativistic principles.

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1. Causal Shells

Each mass emits a causal shell that propagates at the speed of light. This shell encompasses both gravitational and light influences. 

Mathematically, the causal shell around a mass \( m \) at a distance \( r \) is represented as:

\[
C(r) = \frac{E}{4 \pi r^2}
\]

where \( C(r) \) is the causal influence at radius \( r \), and \( E \) is the energy of the mass.

### 2.2. Simultaneity and Causal Intersection

Two events, \( A \) and \( B \), can be considered simultaneous for an observer at position \( P \) if their causal shells intersect at the same spatial location. Specifically, the causal influence from both events must reach \( P \) at the same time, ensuring the intersection of their causal shells at the spatial point of interest.

\[
C_A(P) = C_B(P)
\]

This geometric condition defines the “causal now,” and the events are simultaneous if this condition holds true. This idea parallels the concept of simultaneity in relativity, but with no reliance on a temporal dimension.

### 2.3. Perception of Simultaneity

Just as in the theory of relativity, the perception of simultaneity depends on the relative positions of observers and events. The intersection of causal shells differs for observers in different frames of reference. In this theory, instead of using a time coordinate to synchronize clocks, observers synchronize events based on the spatial intersections of causal shells.

## 3. Mathematical Development

### 3.1. Proof for Arbitrary Starting Coordinates and Showtime

Consider two masses, Alice and Bob, with arbitrary starting coordinates \( A_0 = (x_A, y_A, z_A) \) and \( B_0 = (x_B, y_B, z_B) \) respectively, and masses \( m_A \) and \( m_B \). Let the movie theater be located at coordinates \( (x_T, y_T, z_T) \). We aim to prove that Alice and Bob can meet at the theater for any arbitrary "showtime" using only the spatial geometry of their causal shells.

#### 3.1.1. Causal Influence Propagation

For Alice, the causal shell at distance \( r_A \) from \( A_0 \) to the theater is:

\[
C_A(r_A) = \frac{m_A c^2}{4 \pi r_A^2}
\]
where 
\[
r_A = \sqrt{(x_T - x_A)^2 + (y_T - y_A)^2 + (z_T - z_A)^2}
\]

For Bob, the causal shell at distance \( r_B \) from \( B_0 \) to the theater is:

\[
C_B(r_B) = \frac{m_B c^2}{4 \pi r_B^2}
\]
where 
\[
r_B = \sqrt{(x_T - x_B)^2 + (y_T - y_B)^2 + (z_T - z_B)^2}
\]

#### 3.1.2. Conditions for Intersection

For Alice and Bob to meet at the theater, their causal shells must intersect at the same spatial point:

\[
C_A(r_A) = C_B(r_B)
\]

This gives us:

\[
\frac{m_A c^2}{4 \pi r_A^2} = \frac{m_B c^2}{4 \pi r_B^2}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{m_A}{r_A^2} = \frac{m_B}{r_B^2}
\]

\[
\left( \frac{r_A}{r_B} \right)^2 = \frac{m_A}{m_B}
\]

\[
\frac{r_A}{r_B} = \sqrt{\frac{m_A}{m_B}}
\]

#### 3.1.3. Arbitrary "Showtime" via Spatial Geometry

The "showtime" is defined by the spatial configuration where Alice and Bob's causal shells intersect at the theater. They can adjust their starting positions or paths to ensure:

\[
\frac{r_A}{r_B} = \sqrt{\frac{m_A}{m_B}}
\]

This means that for any given "showtime," Alice and Bob can calculate or adjust their spatial positions so that their causal influences meet at the theater, demonstrating simultaneity without a temporal dimension.

### 3.2. Relativity of Simultaneity in Different Frames

For two observers \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \) moving relative to each other, the intersection of causal shells will vary depending on their positions within the shells. This results in different perceptions of simultaneity for each observer.

Consider two observers \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \), where the position of observer \( O_2 \) is shifted relative to \( O_1 \). The perception of simultaneity for events \( A \) and \( B \) will differ based on the relative position of the observers:

\[
C_A(P_1) \neq C_B(P_1) \quad \text{and} \quad C_A(P_2) \neq C_B(P_2)
\]

Thus, the relative motion of the observers affects the perception of simultaneity, akin to the relativity of simultaneity in classical relativity.

### 3.3. Simultaneity in Multiple Star Systems

The concept of simultaneity becomes even more nuanced when considering multiple light sources, such as a two-star system. In this model, observers positioned at different points within the causal shells of these stars will experience different "causal moments" as light from each star reaches them. For example:

- **Observer A**: Positioned closer to one star and farther from the other, will perceive events from each star at different times based on the propagation of light and the corresponding intersections of causal shells.
- **Observer B**: If equidistant from both stars, will perceive events as simultaneous, as both light shells intersect at the same spatial point at the same causal moment.

This introduces a more complex, yet purely spatial, view of simultaneity that depends solely on the observer’s location relative to the causal light shells.

## 4. Experimental Predictions

### 4.1. Causal Synchronization Experiments

We predict that experiments could be designed to test the synchronization of events based on the intersection of causal shells. These experiments would involve observing light signals or gravitational influences from different sources and verifying whether the causal shells intersect at the same spatial location.

### 4.2. Cosmic Simultaneity

Cosmic observations, such as the study of distant astronomical events, could be interpreted in terms of causal geometry. The cosmic microwave background radiation, for example, may be understood as the intersection of causal shells from distant sources, providing a new framework for interpreting cosmological phenomena.

## 5. Conclusion

By redefining simultaneity in terms of causal shell intersections within a purely spatial framework, we provide a new interpretation of simultaneity that avoids the need for a time dimension. The proof for arbitrary starting coordinates and any showtime demonstrates how causal shells can intersect at a point in space, allowing events to be perceived as simultaneous. This framework aligns with the principles of relativity but offers a more geometrically consistent model that bypasses traditional spacetime concepts. Additionally, this framework opens new avenues for experimental and observational investigations in both terrestrial and cosmic settings.
