### **Relative Motion in Causal Relativity**

---

### **1. Single Moving Mass**

Let’s assume:
- A mass \(m\) moves with velocity \(\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y, v_z)\).
- The shell propagates outward at the speed of light (\(c\)).

At an instantaneous spatial distance \(R\) from the mass, we can describe the shape of the shell as follows:

#### **1.1. Rest Frame (Spherical Symmetry)**
In the rest frame of the mass, the causal shell at distance \(R\) is a sphere:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2
\]

#### **1.2. Moving Mass (Ellipsoidal Symmetry)**
For a mass moving with velocity \(\vec{v}\), the shell is no longer spherical but appears as an ellipsoid due to relativistic effects (length contraction along the direction of motion). The shape is described by:
\[
\frac{(x - v_x)^2}{R^2} + \frac{(y - v_y)^2 + (z - v_z)^2}{\left(\frac{R}{\gamma}\right)^2} = 1
\]
where \(R = ct\) is the spatial distance the signal propagates outward, and:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

This describes an ellipsoid in **purely spatial coordinates**, with:
- Major axis along the motion (\(x\)-axis),
- Minor axes in the transverse (\(y\), \(z\)) directions.

### **2. N-Body System**

For \(N\) masses, each moving with velocity \(\vec{v}_i = (v_{i,x}, v_{i,y}, v_{i,z})\), the causal shells propagate outward from their instantaneous positions.  

The shell for the \(i\)-th mass, centered at \((x_i, y_i, z_i)\), at a spatial distance \(R_i\), is:
\[
\frac{(x - x_i - v_{i,x})^2}{R_i^2} + \frac{(y - y_i - v_{i,y})^2 + (z - z_i - v_{i,z})^2}{\left(\frac{R_i}{\gamma_i}\right)^2} = 1
\]
where \(R_i = ct\), or equivalently:
\[
R_i = \sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2 + (z - z_i)^2}
\]
This ensures the propagation distance is expressed geometrically as the radial distance from each mass’s instantaneous position.

#### **2.1. Interaction of Shells**
For any two masses \(i, j\), their causal shells intersect if the propagation distances \(R_i\) and \(R_j\) satisfy:
\[
\frac{(x - x_i - v_{i,x})^2}{R_i^2} + \frac{(y - y_i - v_{i,y})^2 + (z - z_i - v_{i,z})^2}{\left(\frac{R_i}{\gamma_i}\right)^2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{(x - x_j - v_{j,x})^2}{R_j^2} + \frac{(y - y_j - v_{j,y})^2 + (z - z_j - v_{j,z})^2}{\left(\frac{R_j}{\gamma_j}\right)^2} = 1
\]

### **3. Full Spatial Propagation Model**

#### **3.1. Single Body: 3D Propagation Surface**
For a single mass moving along the \(x\)-axis (\(v_x = v, v_y = v_z = 0\)), the causality shell becomes:
\[
\frac{(x - vt)^2}{(ct)^2} + \frac{y^2 + z^2}{\left(\frac{ct}{\gamma}\right)^2} = 1
\]

By substituting \(R = ct\), we remove explicit time dependence:
\[
\frac{(x - vR/c)^2}{R^2} + \frac{y^2 + z^2}{\left(\frac{R}{\gamma}\right)^2} = 1
\]
This is the **spatial propagation model** of the causal shell.

#### **3.2. N-Body System**
For an \(N\)-body system, the spatial equation of the \(i\)-th shell is:
\[
\frac{(x - x_i - v_{i,x} R_i/c)^2}{R_i^2} + \frac{(y - y_i - v_{i,y} R_i/c)^2 + (z - z_i - v_{i,z} R_i/c)^2}{\left(\frac{R_i}{\gamma_i}\right)^2} = 1
\]

Where:
- \(R_i = c \cdot t = \sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2 + (z - z_i)^2}\).

This system defines \(N\) interacting ellipsoids, where the spatial separation and overlap govern the causal interactions.

### **4. Mathematical Simplification for Visual Representation**
#### **4.1. Ellipsoid Intersection**
The intersection of two shells is defined geometrically as:
\[
\frac{(x - x_1)^2}{R_1^2} + \frac{(y - y_1)^2 + (z - z_1)^2}{\left(\frac{R_1}{\gamma_1}\right)^2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{(x - x_2)^2}{R_2^2} + \frac{(y - y_2)^2 + (z - z_2)^2}{\left(\frac{R_2}{\gamma_2}\right)^2} = 1
\]

These equations describe the intersection of ellipsoids in 3D space, which can be solved numerically or visualized graphically.

#### **4.2. N-Body Visualization**
For \(N\) bodies, simulate the outward propagation of causality shells in 3D, plotting the ellipsoids as they expand over time.
