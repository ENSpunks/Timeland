# Simultaneity without Time

## Abstract

This paper explores the concept of simultaneity within the Causal Relativity geometry, where traditional spacetime concepts are replaced by causal interactions within a three-dimensional spatial framework. We argue that simultaneity can be understood as the intersection of dynamic causal shells from different masses moving through space, without invoking a time coordinate. Using refined mathematical formulations, we prove that events can be considered simultaneous when their moving causal shells intersect at a specific spatial point. This approach resolves relativity's challenges surrounding simultaneity by bypassing the need for a temporal dimension, offering new insights into complex relativistic scenarios involving gravitational effects and astronomical observations.

## 1. Introduction

In Einstein's theory of relativity, simultaneity is observer-dependent, arising from the constancy of the speed of light. However, in the Causal Relativity framework, we redefine simultaneity through the spatial interaction of causal shells, which propagate from masses at the speed of light. This model posits that events are simultaneous when their causal influences meet at the same spatial location, providing a framework devoid of traditional time but consistent with observed phenomena. We aim to demonstrate how this can simplify yet maintain the essence of relativistic effects through spatial geometry alone.

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1. Dynamic Causal Shells

Each mass emits a causal shell that expands at the speed of light, encapsulating both light and gravitational effects. For moving masses, the shell's expansion is dynamically influenced by the mass's velocity:

\[
C(r, t) = \frac{m c^2}{4 \pi (r - vt)^2}
\]

where \( C(r, t) \) is the causal influence at a distance \( r \) from a mass \( m \) moving with velocity \( v \), and \( t \) represents the spatial change or pseudo-time parameter.

### 2.2. Simultaneity and Causal Intersection for Moving Masses

Considering two masses, Alice and Bob, with velocities \( v_A \) and \( v_B \) respectively, their causal shells intersect when:

\[
C_A(r_A - v_A \Delta s) = C_B(r_B - v_B \Delta s)
\]

Here, \( \Delta s \) represents a spatial change analogous to time in traditional physics, where:

\[
\Delta s = \Delta r \quad \text{or} \quad \Delta s = \int v(t) \, dt
\]

### 2.3. Perception of Simultaneity

The perception of simultaneity in this model is influenced by the relative positions and velocities of observers and events. Instead of temporal synchronization, events are synchronized based on where and how their moving causal shells intersect in space.

## 3. Mathematical Development

### 3.1. Proof for Arbitrary Starting Coordinates and Showtime with Motion

Given two moving masses, Alice at \( A_0 = (x_A, y_A, z_A) \) with mass \( m_A \) and velocity \( v_A \), and Bob at \( B_0 = (x_B, y_B, z_B) \) with mass \( m_B \) and velocity \( v_B \), we aim to prove they can meet at a theater \( T = (x_T, y_T, z_T) \) for any spatial configuration:

#### 3.1.1. Causal Influence Propagation

- For Alice:

\[
C_A(r_A) = \frac{m_A c^2}{4 \pi (r_A - v_A \Delta s)^2}
\]

where \( r_A \) is the initial distance from Alice to the theater.

- For Bob:

\[
C_B(r_B) = \frac{m_B c^2}{4 \pi (r_B - v_B \Delta s)^2}
\]

where \( r_B \) is the initial distance from Bob to the theater.

#### 3.1.2. Conditions for Intersection

For simultaneity:

\[
\frac{m_A}{(r_A - v_A \Delta s)^2} = \frac{m_B}{(r_B - v_B \Delta s)^2}
\]

This leads to:

\[
\frac{r_A - v_A \Delta s}{r_B - v_B \Delta s} = \sqrt{\frac{m_A}{m_B}}
\]

#### 3.1.3. Arbitrary "Showtime" via Spatial Geometry

The "showtime" or spatial configuration where their causal influences meet at the theater can be calculated by:

\[
\Delta s = \frac{r_A - r_B \sqrt{\frac{m_A}{m_B}}}{v_A - v_B \sqrt{\frac{m_A}{m_B}}}
\]

This shows that for any given spatial arrangement, Alice and Bob can adjust their paths to intersect at the theater, defining simultaneity without time.

### 3.2. Relativity of Simultaneity in Different Frames

For moving observers, the intersection of causal shells reflects the relativity of simultaneity through spatial geometry:

\[
C_A(P_1 - v_A \Delta s) \neq C_B(P_1 - v_B \Delta s) \quad \text{and} \quad C_A(P_2 - v_A \Delta s) \neq C_B(P_2 - v_B \Delta s)
\]

### 3.3. Simultaneity in Dynamic Scenarios

This model extends to scenarios like multiple star systems, where the perception of simultaneity for different observers depends on their spatial location within the dynamic causal shells.

## 4. Experimental Predictions

### 4.1. Causal Synchronization Experiments

Experiments could involve observing the intersection of causal shells from moving objects, verifying predictions about spatial simultaneity.

### 4.2. Cosmic Simultaneity

The model suggests new interpretations for cosmic phenomena, like interpreting the cosmic microwave background through the lens of intersecting causal shells from various cosmic sources.

## 5. Potential Applications

- **Navigation in Space**: This model could simplify navigation algorithms for spacecraft by focusing on spatial geometry, potentially reducing computational complexity for calculating trajectories and rendezvous in space.

- **Gravitational Wave Detection**: By considering spatial interactions, new methods for detecting and interpreting gravitational waves might be developed, focusing on how mass influences space rather than spacetime.

- **Quantum Mechanics**: The spatial approach might offer insights into quantum entanglement and causality, exploring how quantum events might be simultaneous in a spatial context.

- **Astronomy**: Understanding light from distant stars or galaxies through causal shells could lead to new techniques for dating astronomical events or understanding light propagation in complex gravitational fields.

- **Time Dilation Alternatives**: In scenarios where time dilation is observed, this model might provide alternative explanations or predictions based purely on spatial curvature and causal influence propagation.

## 6. Conclusion

By integrating the dynamics of moving masses into our spatial interpretation of simultaneity, we've refined the Causal Relativity framework to handle scenarios involving motion more robustly. This approach not only maintains consistency with known relativistic effects but also proposes new ways to conceptualize causality and simultaneity purely in spatial terms. Future work should focus on empirical validations and further mathematical development to handle acceleration and non-uniform motions within this framework.
