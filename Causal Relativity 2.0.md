### **Abstract**

The **Theory of Causal Relativity** introduces a new **Causal Geometry** that interprets physical phenomena in a purely spatial context, eliminating the need for a time dimension. This approach unifies concepts from Special and General Relativity into a three-dimensional framework.

---

### **Introduction**

The paper proposes **Causal Relativity**, a novel interpretation of relativity where time is not a dimension but causality is represented through spatial interactions. The **TimeLand** analogy from *Flatland* helps visualize this concept in 3D space.

### **Postulates of Relativity**

#### **Newton's Postulates**:

- Space and time are absolute and separate.
- Gravity acts instantaneously.
- Light speed varies with observers.

#### **Einstein's Postulates**:

- Physics laws are consistent across inertial frames.
- Light speed is constant.
- Space and time form a 4D spacetime.

#### **Causal Relativity Postulates**:

- Laws of physics are frame-independent.
- Space is 3D and curved by mass and energy.
- Causality is a constant relative to each observer in space independent of time.

### **Causal Spheres**

**Causal Geometry** uses three spheres:

- **Mass Cores**: Represent mass effects, analogous to FutureSpace or quantized mass.
- **Light Shells**: Represent light propagation, seen as PastSpace.
- **Gravity Shells**: Describe gravitational effects, akin to Present in spatial terms.

These spheres interact to form the geometry of relativity effects without time.
