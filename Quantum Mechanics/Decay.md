# Decay in Causal Geometry

## Abstract

This paper investigates how particle decay can be conceptualized in Causal Relativity, where the breakdown of a particle is viewed as a spatial reconfiguration of holomass rather than a temporal process.

## Introduction

Decay in traditional quantum mechanics is a time-dependent process. Here, we propose a model where decay is an event of spatial "breaking" or transformation of causal spheres, maintaining energy conservation through spatial interactions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Holomass and Decay

- **Holomass:** Quantized mass distributed on the boundary of spatial curvature, representing particle states.
- **Decay:** The transition of holomass from one spatial configuration to another, where mass-energy is redistributed through spatial changes.

### Spatial Decay Dynamics

#### Conservation of Energy

In Causal Geometry, \(E = mc^2\) remains true, but the conservation is spatial:

- Decay involves the spatial redistribution of mass-energy among new particles or photons.
- The process is akin to a hologram or causal sphere transforming, where the total energy remains constant but is spatially reorganized.

#### Decay and Photon Emission

- **Photon Emission:** Seen as spatial emissions due to changes in holomass configuration on the boundary.
- **Spatial Causality:** The interaction between different parts of the causal geometry leads to what we observe as decay.

## Conclusion

This framework redefines decay by focusing on spatial configurations, suggesting that what we perceive as time-dependent decay is inherently a spatial phenomenon in Causal Relativity. Experimental and theoretical validations are crucial for this model.
