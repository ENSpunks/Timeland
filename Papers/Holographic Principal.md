# Causal Relativity: Holographic Principle Without Time

### Holographic Principle in the Context of Causal Relativity

| **Causal Geometry** | **Phenomenon** | **Original Equation** | **Causal Relativity Equation** |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Mass+Light+Gravity** | **Holographic Principle** | \( S = \frac{A}{4l_p^2} \) | \( S = \frac{\pi r^2}{l_p^2} \) |

## Summary of Interpretation

The Holographic Principle within Causal Relativity posits that the information within a 3D spatial volume is encoded on a 2D surface, the gravity causal shell. Here, time is not a fundamental dimension; instead, interactions between mass and light are delineated through spatial curvature. Gravity is reimagined as a boundary condition where quantized mass and light interact, with the gravity shell mediating these interactions.

**Holomass:** In this context, holomass is quantized mass encoded on the boundary of spatial curvature, reflecting the idea that all physical information within a region of space can be described by its surface in discrete units of Planck area.

**Holomass and Photon Emission:** Holomass, encoded on this boundary, acts as a source for photon emission. This interaction is conceptualized as quantum field theory at the boundary, where the emission of photons is a result of transitions in these quantized masses.

## Developing the Mathematics

### Original Holographic Principle

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes:

\[ S = \frac{A}{4l_p^2} \]

where \( l_p \) is the Planck length, indicating that entropy or information is proportional to the boundary area.

### Transition to Causal Geometry

In Causal Relativity, we eliminate time, focusing on spatial dimensions:

- **Area as Information Encoding**: The information content of a 3D region is encoded on its 2D boundary, where holomass resides.

- **Equation Adjustment**: We modify to include the Planck length while maintaining a focus on geometry:

\[ S = \frac{\pi r^2}{l_p^2} \]

This equation now accounts for the quantum nature of information storage on the boundary.

### Rigorous Mathematical Development

1. **Area as a Boundary Condition**: 
   - The area \( A \) now represents the sum of Planck areas where holomass is encoded:

   \[
   A = N \cdot l_p^2
   \]

   Here, \( N \) is the number of Planck areas, directly related to the information content:

   \[
   S = \frac{N}{4}
   \]

2. **Quantized Mass and Light Interaction**:
   - Holomass on the boundary interacts with light through quantum field theory principles, with the spatial curvature affecting light propagation.

3. **Curvature and Encoding**:
   - The curvature of space around mass encodes holomass on the boundary, from which photons are emitted, maintaining geometric unity with mass.

### Calculating a Known Problem

Consider the entropy of a black hole:

- **Traditional Calculation**: For a Schwarzschild black hole of mass \( M \), the horizon area is \( A = 16\pi G^2 M^2/c^4 \). Using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula:

\[ S_{traditional} = \frac{4\pi G M^2}{l_p^2 c^2} \]

- **Causal Geometry Calculation**: Here, we adapt:

\[ A_{causal} = N \cdot l_p^2 \]
\[ S_{causal} = \frac{N}{4} \]

Where \( N \) corresponds to the number of Planck areas on the causal boundary, directly proportional to the radius \( r \) in Planck units.

### Unification

In this model, gravity and light interactions are spatial, with photons and mass geometrically unified at the quantum boundary:

- **Gravity**: A spatial boundary condition where holomass and light interact.
- **Light**: Propagates due to spatial curvature from the holomass.

### Predictions

- **Observation of Quantum Spatial Effects**: Gravitational lensing or other effects might show quantum signatures at the boundary.

- **New Gravitational Signatures**: Predictions might include phenomena linked to how holomass emits photons from discrete Planck areas on the boundary.

## Conclusion

Causal Relativity reinterprets the Holographic Principle by removing time, proposing that physical phenomena are described through spatial geometry with quantum encoding at the boundary. This challenges our understanding of information, entropy, and causality, offering new gravitational insights. Experimental validation is crucial to confirm these propositions.
