Schrödinger Equation in Causal Geometry

Abstract
This paper reinterprets the Schrödinger equation within the framework of Causal Relativity, where time is replaced by spatial interactions. We propose that quantum evolution is a function of spatial configuration rather than temporal progression.

Introduction
Traditional quantum mechanics describes the evolution of quantum states over time using the Schrödinger equation. Here, we explore how this can be reformulated in a time-less geometry, where spatial interactions govern quantum dynamics.

Theoretical Framework

Causal Geometry Revisited
Causal Relativity posits that all physical interactions occur within a purely spatial 3D framework. The Hamiltonian operator is redefined to account for spatial curvature and mass-light interactions.

Modified Schrödinger Equation
The conventional time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)

is transformed into:

i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \psi(\mathbf{r}, \sigma) = \hat{H}_{\sigma} \psi(\mathbf{r}, \sigma)

where:
- \sigma represents a spatial parameter or configuration.
- \hat{H}_{\sigma} is a spatially-dependent Hamiltonian, including terms for spatial curvature, mass distribution, and light interaction.

Spatial Quantum Dynamics
- Eigenstates: Now correspond to spatial configurations rather than energy levels over time.
- Wave Function: Describes probability distributions in spatial coordinates.

Conclusion
This reformulation suggests that quantum phenomena can be understood without time, focusing instead on spatial interactions. Further research is needed to explore the implications for quantum interference, tunneling, and other phenomena.
