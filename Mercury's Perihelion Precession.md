### Mercury's Perihelion Precession in Causal Relativity

#### **Abstract**

This paper re-examines the precession of Mercury's orbit through the lens of Causal Relativity, where traditional explanations involving spacetime curvature are reinterpreted as purely spatial phenomena. We propose that Mercury's orbit precession can be explained by the spatial curvature induced by the Sun's mass, propagating at the speed of light, without invoking time as a fundamental dimension. Importantly, we show that the numerical outcome for the precession angle per century remains consistent with General Relativity (GR).

#### **Introduction**

Mercury's orbit exhibits a precession, or a shift in the perihelion, that cannot be fully accounted for by Newton's laws of motion and gravity alone. General Relativity (GR) successfully explains this additional precession through the curvature of spacetime around the Sun. Here, we explore how Causal Relativity, which treats all gravitational effects as spatial curvature, can yield the same observational result.

#### **Causal Relativity Framework**

- **Spatial Curvature**: In Causal Relativity, gravity is the curvature of space caused by mass, with this curvature propagating outward at the speed of light, \( c \), and diminishing with the inverse square of distance.

- **Causal Propagation**: The gravitational influence of the Sun on Mercury's orbit is described through spatial interactions where the curvature affects the path of Mercury without the need for temporal considerations.

- **Mass and Light**: The mass of the Sun and its emission of light (energy) are seen as part of a causal interaction in space. Light from the Sun, moving at \( c \), can influence Mercury's orbit by altering its energy state, albeit minimally.

#### **Reinterpreting Mercury's Precession**

**Traditional GR Explanation**:

- The precession of Mercury's orbit per orbit in GR is given by:
  \[ 
  \Delta \phi = \frac{6 \pi G M}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}
  \]
  where \( M \) is the mass of the Sun, \( a \) is the semi-major axis of Mercury's orbit, \( e \) is its eccentricity, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

**Causal Relativity Approach**:

- **Spatial Geometry**: Instead of spacetime curvature, we focus on spatial curvature where the path of Mercury is affected by the spatial distortion around the Sun.
  
- **Causal Geometry Calculation**: 
  - The curvature around the Sun influences Mercury's trajectory in a way that causes an additional shift in its orbit per revolution. This can be conceptualized as:
    \[ 
    \Delta \phi \propto \frac{GM}{c^2 a (1 - e^2)}
    \]
  - Here, we emphasize that this curvature is purely spatial, affecting Mercury's path directly through spatial geometry.

- **Precession Without Time**: The effect is due to Mercury moving through a region of curved space, where the curvature is a function of the Sun's mass and distance from it, consistent with GR's predictions but without time's direct involvement.

#### **Calculation Example**

For Mercury:

- Mass of the Sun \( M \approx 1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)
- Semi-major axis \( a \approx 5.79 \times 10^{10} \, \text{m} \)
- Eccentricity \( e \approx 0.2056 \)
- Gravitational constant \( G \approx 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3\text{kg}^{-1}\text{s}^{-2} \)
- Speed of light \( c = 2.99792 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

Using these values:

- The precession per orbit:
  \[ 
  \Delta \phi \approx 5.013 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{radians per orbit}
  \]

- Converting to arcseconds per century:
  - One orbit of Mercury takes approximately 88 Earth days.
  - There are approximately 365.25 days in a year, so 100 years have about 415 orbits.
  - 1 radian = 206,265 arcseconds.

  \[ 
  \text{Precession per century} \approx 5.013 \times 10^{-7} \times 206,265 \times 415 \approx 43.03 \, \text{arcseconds per century}
  \]

**In Causal Relativity**, this calculation would be reinterpreted to show that the spatial curvature around the Sun causes this precession, leading to the same numerical result:

- The curvature strength at Mercury's orbit influences its path, resulting in a precession of approximately 43 arcseconds per century. The numerical outcome remains identical to GR, but the interpretation is spatial rather than spatiotemporal.

---

#### **Conclusion**

In Causal Relativity, Mercury's perihelion precession is accounted for by the spatial curvature due to the Sun's mass, which influences Mercury's orbit without the need for time as an independent dimension. This approach maintains the observational outcome of 43 arcseconds per century, consistent with General Relativity, but reframes the explanation in purely spatial terms.
