| **Causal Set Theory**         | Proposes that spacetime is fundamentally discrete, and the causal relationships between events define the geometry. | Still operates within a 4D spacetime framework. Causal Relativity seeks to eliminate time as an independent dimension. |
| **Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)** | A quantum gravity approach where spacetime is constructed from discrete building blocks, with a well-defined causal structure. | Uses time as a dimension to maintain causality; Causal Relativity aims for a purely spatial interpretation. |
| **Causal Fermion Systems**    | Aims at unifying all fundamental forces by describing spacetime as emerging from causal structures of fermion systems. | Maintains a spacetime framework; does not eliminate time but reinterprets its emergence. |
| **Causal Graph Theory in Physics** | Used to model causal relationships in quantum field theory or statistical mechanics, typically via directed graphs. | Works within existing spacetime dimensions, focusing on causal order without altering time's dimensionality. |
| **Shape Dynamics**             | Considers the evolution of spatial shapes instead of spacetime.             | Involves time but reinterprets it through spatial changes; Causal Relativity aims for a relativistic interpretation without time. |
| **Emergent Space-Time Theories** | Theories where spacetime emerges from more fundamental entities or structures (e.g., Erik Verlinde's Emergent Gravity). | Time remains, often as an emergent property, contrasting with Causal Relativity's aim to remove time as a fundamental dimension. |`​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
