| **Mercury's Perihelion Precession**              | Reinterpret as spatial curvature influencing Mercury's orbital path without time's involvement.                       | ✅        |
| **Twin Paradox**                                 | Explore how spatial contraction and different paths through space affect the twins' "age" or spatial separation.     | ✅        |
| **Gravitational Time Dilation**                 | Interpret as a spatial effect where spatial intervals near a mass are stretched, affecting the rate at which events occur. |           |
| **Gravitational Lensing**                        | Reinterpret the bending of light as a result of spatial curvature rather than spacetime curvature.                   |           |
| **Length Contraction in High-Speed Travel**      | Consider as a spatial transformation where the object's spatial extent is reduced due to relative motion.           |           |
| **Relativistic Doppler Effect**                  | View as a spatial wave compression or expansion due to the relative motion between spatial points.                   |           |
| **Black Hole Event Horizons**                    | Describe the event horizon as a boundary of extreme spatial curvature where light paths loop back into the black hole. |           |
| **Frame-Dragging (Lense-Thirring Effect)**       | Reinterpret as spatial geometry around a rotating body influencing paths, altering trajectories without time.       |           |
| **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Anisotropy** | Explore how spatial variations in energy distribution could account for the CMB anisotropies.                         |           |
| **Relativistic Jet Formation in Active Galactic Nuclei** | Consider how spatial curvature and energy transfer in space could account for jet formation.                         |           |
