### **Theory of Causal Relativity**

#### **Abstract**

The Theory of Causal Relativity proposes a causal geometry independent of time.

---

#### **Introduction**

Time has long been a central axis of our understanding of the universe, treated either as an independent variable in Newtonian mechanics or as an inseparable component of spacetime in Einstein's theory of relativity. However, the conceptual challenges posed by time—such as black holes singularities and the infinite regression of "when"—hint at the possibility that time might not be fundamental but rather an emergent or projected property.

**Timeland**, inspired by Edwin Abbott’s *Flatland*, provides an illustrative analogy: just as Flatland uses 2D creatures to explore the implications of higher dimensions, Timeland frames the experience of time as a projection of higher-dimensional spatial relationships. The Theory of Causal Relativity builds on this analogy, treating time as a spatial phenomenon and unifying relativistic effects through a new geometry, **causal geometry**.

#### **Postulates of Relativity**

##### **Newton’s Postulates**:

1. Space and time are absolute and independent of observers.
2. Forces cause acceleration; gravity acts instantaneously at a distance.
3. Light behaves as particles, with speed dependent on the observer's motion.

For Newton, **time** is an independent variable, and **space** is absolute. We move from these classical views into the relativistic framework, which requires a **unified view** of space and time.

---

##### **Einstein’s Postulates**:

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.
2. The speed of light \( c \) in a vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of the observer or source.
3. Space and time are unified into 4D spacetime, which curves under mass/energy.

Einstein's theory introduces **spacetime curvature**, where time and space are treated as inseparable components of a 4D continuum. However, this continuum is **modified** in **causal relativity** to treat **space** as 3D, with **time** acting as a **projection** into the spatial framework.

---

##### **Causal Relativity Postulates**:

1. Mass is the 3D cross-section of a 4D manifold, with the 4D volume of the observer projected as quantized mass in 3D space.
2. Light is a massless form of energy \( E \) that propagates outward from mass in all directions at the speed of causality \( c \), creating a causal light sphere.
3. Gravity is the curvature of 3D space in the presence of a 3D cross-section of a 4D manifold, propagating outward from mass in all directions at the speed of causality \( c \), forming a causal gravity sphere.
4. Mass, light, and gravity can be unified geometrically between any two observers in relative inertial frames, independent of a time dimension.

These postulates define the foundational framework of causal relativity, where the geometric interactions of mass, light, and gravity are treated as manifestations of a higher-dimensional manifold and described geometrically in 3D space.

---

#### **Core Concepts**

- **Central Sphere (Mass):** Each mass is visualized as a sphere in 3D space, representing the 3D cross-section of a 4D manifold where the mass's 4D volume is projected.

- **Causal Light Shell:** Mass emits light, forming an expanding shell at the speed of light, carrying the energy information of the mass as photons.

- **Causal Gravity Sphere:** Gravity is the curvature of space around the mass, forming another expanding shell that warps space inversely proportional to distance.

- **Observer Independence:** The interaction of these spheres and shells with others is frame-independent, described through spatial geometry, not time.

#### **Causal Geometry**

Causal Relativity translates the mathematics of 4D spacetime into 3D causal geometry, with time-dependent effects reinterpreted as spatial phenomena.

| **Causal Set Theory**         | Proposes that spacetime is fundamentally discrete, and the causal relationships between events define the geometry. | Still operates within a 4D spacetime framework. Causal Relativity seeks to eliminate time as an independent dimension. |
| **Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)** | A quantum gravity approach where spacetime is constructed from discrete building blocks, with a well-defined causal structure. | Uses time as a dimension to maintain causality; Causal Relativity aims for a purely spatial interpretation. |
| **Causal Fermion Systems**    | Aims at unifying all fundamental forces by describing spacetime as emerging from causal structures of fermion systems. | Maintains a spacetime framework; does not eliminate time but reinterprets its emergence. |
| **Causal Graph Theory in Physics** | Used to model causal relationships in quantum field theory or statistical mechanics, typically via directed graphs. | Works within existing spacetime dimensions, focusing on causal order without altering time's dimensionality. |
| **Shape Dynamics**             | Considers the evolution of spatial shapes instead of spacetime.             | Involves time but reinterprets it through spatial changes; Causal Relativity aims for a relativistic interpretation without time. |
| **Emergent Space-Time Theories** | Theories where spacetime emerges from more fundamental entities or structures (e.g., Erik Verlinde's Emergent Gravity). | Time remains, often as an emergent property, contrasting with Causal Relativity's aim to remove time as a fundamental dimension. |`​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
