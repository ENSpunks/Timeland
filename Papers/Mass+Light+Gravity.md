# Theory of Causal Relativity: Holography Without Time

### Holographic Principle in the Context of Causal Relativity

| **Causal Geometry** | **Phenomenon** | **Original Equation** | **Causal Relativity Equation** |
|---------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Mass+Light+Gravity** | **Holographic Principle** | \( S = \frac{A}{4l_p^2} \) | \( A = 4\pi r^2 \) |

## Summary of Interpretation

The Holographic Principle within Causal Relativity suggests that all the information within a 3D spatial volume can be encoded on a 2D surface, specifically the gravity causal shell. Here, time is not considered a fundamental dimension; instead, the interactions between mass and light are described through spatial curvature alone. This approach redefines gravity as a boundary condition where quantized mass and photons are encoded, with the gravity shell acting as the mediator for these interactions.

## Developing the Mathematics

### Original Holographic Principle

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for black holes relates entropy \( S \) to the area \( A \) of the event horizon:

\[ S = \frac{A}{4l_p^2} \]

where \( l_p \) is the Planck length, indicating that the entropy or amount of information in a region of space is proportional to the area of its boundary rather than its volume.

### Transition to Causal Geometry

In Causal Relativity, we remove the time dimension, focusing purely on spatial dimensions. Here, we propose:

- **Area as Information Encoding**: The information content of a 3D spatial region is encoded on its 2D boundary, which is the surface of the gravity sphere.

- **Equation Simplification**: We drop the dependency on Planck length, focusing solely on the geometric aspect:

\[ A = 4\pi r^2 \]

This equation represents the area of the sphere where the information is encoded, without any reference to time or quantum effects directly.

### Rigorous Mathematical Development

1. **Area as a Boundary Condition**: 
   - The area \( A \) of the sphere is not just a measure but represents the full information content of the enclosed 3D space. 

2. **Quantized Mass and Light Interaction**:
   - Mass (FutureSpace) and light (PastSpace) interact on this boundary. The mass's spatial curvature (without time) influences the propagation of light, which is now described by spatial intervals rather than temporal ones.

3. **Curvature and Encoding**:
   - The curvature of space around mass causes a spatial "encoding" effect where light and mass are described by how they interact with this curvature, rather than how they evolve in time.

### Calculating a Known Problem

Consider the entropy of a black hole:

- **Traditional Calculation**: For a Schwarzschild black hole of mass \( M \), the horizon area is \( A = 16\pi G^2 M^2/c^4 \). Using the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, we get:

\[ S_{traditional} = \frac{4\pi G M^2}{l_p^2 c^2} \]

- **Causal Geometry Calculation**: Here, we're not dealing with entropy directly but with how information is spatially encoded. For simplicity, if we consider just the area:

\[ A_{causal} = 4\pi r^2 \]

Where \( r \) is now a spatial radius rather than a coordinate in spacetime. Without time, we consider how this area is the maximum boundary for information encoding.

### Unification

In traditional relativity, spacetime curvature dictates both gravity and the path of light. In Causal Relativity, this is reinterpreted:

- **Gravity**: As a spatial boundary condition where mass and light interact.
- **Light**: Propagates based on spatial curvature, not spacetime.

This unification suggests that all fundamental interactions might be described through spatial geometry alone.

### Predictions

- **Observation of Spatial Effects**: Effects traditionally ascribed to time (like gravitational lensing) might be observed purely through spatial distortions.
- **New Gravitational Signatures**: If gravity is indeed a boundary condition, we might predict new types of gravitational waves or spatial distortions around massive objects.

## Conclusion

Causal Relativity reinterprets the Holographic Principle by removing the time dimension, proposing that all physical phenomena can be described through spatial geometry. This framework challenges our understanding of information, entropy, and causality, potentially offering new insights into gravitational physics. However, rigorous experimental validation is needed to substantiate these theoretical propositions.
